                        <p>
                            Close, however, our marionette has been designed to understand english sentences that come in the form of an imperative.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Imperative Sentence</h2>
                        <p>
                            A type of sentence that gives advice or instructions or that expresses a request or command.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An imperative sentence typically begins with the base form of a verb. The implied subject <i>you</i> is said to be "understood".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An imperative sentence ends with a period or an exclamation point.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Examples</h3>

                        <p>Sentence:</p>
                        <pre>Dial me in to my conference.</pre>

                        <p>
                            Because our API will be made up of commands, we can safely assume that all imperative sentences will begin with an <b>imperative mood</b>, or the base form of a verb.
                        </p>

                        <pre>Dial</pre>

                        <p>
                            This verb will be used to express a request or a command that can be mapped to one or many actions.  Ok, great! We have our verb, but now what?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Using our verb we can create rules to determine what we should do with this command with the help of the remainder of our sentence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In an imperative sentence there will be something that adds meaning to our verb.  Either an <b>adjective</b>, <b>adverb</b>, or, in this case, a <b>prepositional phrase</b>
                        <p>                            

                        <pre>in to my conference</pre>

                        <p>
                            We don't really care about the prepositional phrase, we care about the part that adds meaning to our verb. In this case it happens to be <b>the object of the preposition</b>
                        </p>

                        <pre>conference</pre>

                        <p>
                            Once we find our verb, we are always going to search the sentence for a word that gives meaing to our verb and makes sense with our verb.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At this point we could search for further modifications; however, to simplify processing on our end I will assume our <b>object of the verb</b> is always going to be the person making the request.
                        <p>

                        <pre>me</pre>

                        <p>
                            Request? <b>Dial</b>
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            <b>Dial</b> what? a <b>Conference</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Dial</b> a <b>conference</b> for who? <b>me</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We simply search for the most recent event with a conference the requester is participating in and dial them to this call.
                        </p>
